## Introduction

The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) is the largest public transportation agency in New England, delivering a complex system of subway, bus, commuter rail, light rail, and ferry services to riders in the dynamic economy of the Greater Boston Area. It is estimated that MBTA provides over 1.3 million trips on an average weekday. While MBTA collects a wealth of trip transaction data on a daily basis, a persistent limitation has been the organizationâ€™s lack of knowledge around rider groups and their respective ridership habits. Understanding rider segmentation in the context of pattern-of-use has significant implications in developing new policies to improve its service planning and potentially changing its fare structure.

## Package Structure

The high-level functionality of this rider segmentation package is to group individual MBTA riders according to pattern-of-use dimensions. The Python segmentation package has the following structure:

```sh
Rider-Segmentation-Full-App/
    MBTAdashboard/
    MBTAriderSegmentation/
        data/
            cached_clusters/
                hierarchical/
                non-hierarchical/
            cached_features/
            cached_profiles/
            input/
                census/
                geojson/
            report_models/
                report_cnn.h5
        __init__.py
        config.py
        features.py
        profile.py
        report.py
        segmentation.py
        visualization.py
```

A brief description of each item:

- **`data/` directory** contains the input data files (i.e., US census data, geojson data which is used to draw maps) and output result files (i.e. extracted feature in `cached_features`, segmentation results in `cached_clusters`, profiled cluster summaries in `cached_profiles` and a trained CNN model to classify temporal patterns in `report_models`) .

- **`config.py` module** defines global constants (e.g., data path, file prefix, rider type dictionary) that are used in the other modules.

- **`feature.py` module** extracts different sets of rider-level features ([details](https://ac297r-mbta-2018.github.io/Final-Report/feature.html)) from transaction-level data and save the extracted features in the `data/cached_features/` directory.

- **`segmentation.py` module** implements the K-means and LDA clustering algorithm and save the rider features with its cluster assignment in the `data/cached_clusters/` directory.

- **`profile.py` module** aggregated the rider features by cluster assignments and generates a text summary that describes the cluster size, average number of trips, predicted rider type (by using the report.py module), weekday / weekend hours and the zip code associated with the most traffic for each cluster. The profiled clusters are saved in the `data/cached_profiles/` directory.

- **`report.py` module** is called by `profile.py` to format the generated cluster description for each cluster. The column of generated summary texts is appended to the profiled cluster data frame.

- **`visualization.py` module** implements all types of visualization graphs in python.

## Installation

- Step 1: Download code from our [github](https://github.com/AC297r-MBTA-2018/Rider-Segmentation-Full-App)
